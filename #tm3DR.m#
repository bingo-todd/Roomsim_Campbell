function [tm]=tm3DR(psi_rad,theta_rad,phi_rad);
%Usage: [tm]=tm3DR(psi_rad,theta_rad,phi_rad); %  Rotational transformation matrix
%Used to transform the coordinates of a 3D position vector xyz=[x;y;z] from an inertial axes system
% into the coordinates as viewed from a "rotating body" axes system, rotated in yaw, pitch & roll.
% In terms of a rotating body axes (+ve z up, +ve x forward, +ve y to left) i.e. MATLAB convention
% +ve psi_rad is the yaw angle in the xy plane anti-clockwise from the positive x axis (slew left).
% +ve theta_rad is the pitch angle from the xy plane (nose down). NB -ve of MATLAB convention.
% +ve phi_rad is roll clockwise about the +ve x axis (right wing dips).
