% roomsim_core.m is a MATLAB m-code implementation of a mirror image model of the impulse response from an 
%   omni-directional source to a receiver (sensor, two sensors or two ears of a head) in a "shoebox" room.
% It incorporates frequency dependent absorption at the reflective surfaces and in the airspace of the room.
% The simulation of the head utilises Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) data
%   actually Head Related Impulse Response (HRIR) data provided from measurements made either;
%   1)on a Kemar mannequin at MIT. (http://xenia.media.mit.edu/~kdm/hrtf.html ,Dec 2002)
%   or
%   2)on real subjects and a Kemar at University of California, Davis. (http://interface.cipic.ucdavis.edu ,Dec 2002).
% The kernel of the image method in Roomsim is derived from the Fortran program reported by Allen and Berkley,1979 [A6]).
